Drupal Installation Profile


This Drupal Installation profile has WAY to much stuff. Made that way on purpose. It's got all the basics for any Drupal install, plus extras for any video support, plus a ton of extras for displaying dynamic content. Built off of the work done by incredible developers, just combined into one.

The purpose of this install profile is so that devs can simply delete what they do not need from the various files, then run a drush make. I've tested it using a few different configurations and not seen any problems. Let me know if you run into any issues. Hoping to have this evolve into a full fledged distro.


GOAL:
A drupal distrobution where devs can enable all the modules and configs they want at the time of the profile installation point during the drupal install. Streamlined Drupal development.


TODO:
Use case testing
Serious Code refinement
